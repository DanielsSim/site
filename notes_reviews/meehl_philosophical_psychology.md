# Notes on Paul Meehl's 1989 Philosophical Psychology Lectures on Philosophy of Science, Epistemology and Good Reasoning

> If you're not having fun you might as well be dead. What good is a PhD if it's not fun? So that's the main thing about this course. (#1 16:50)

In 1989, Paul Meehl gave his annual lectures on philosophical psychology. As he puts it "somebody had the bright idea of hollywooding this course as I had just passed my 69th birthday and they maybe thought I'd have a coronary and be dead shortly -- in any case I retire after next year". You can find the lectures on [a dedicated site by the University of Minnesota](https://meehl.umn.edu/video) (including lecture notes and download options) or [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmLP5tlplEP4rKMjGf3xafQ/videos?view=0&sort=da&flow=grid). 

(Something that's really great about the 20th century: much of the important actors and acts got captured on video and are available at any time for all of us, free of charge. Look up any important person alive at least up to 1950 on Youtube and you can for example [watch Albert Einstein crack jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAxQERKy6Ug), listen to [the BBC interview Carl Gustav Jung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AMu-G51yTY) or [get a physics lecture by Richard Feynman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRE0GxT6Zbw). Once I figured this out, I switched from reading biographys on Wikipedia to directly binging on lecture and interview recordings.)

I've now listened to them three times and taken extensive notes; I've recommended the lectures to literally dozens of people and most importantly, I've greatly benefited personally from them with tons of great insights transferring into my daily work as an engineer. So if listening to 20h of lectures is your thing, I highly recommend stopping here, getting the lectures in the format of your choice (UoM also offers MP3 downloads) and enjoying the ride. One note before you go: a few recordings have bad audio quality, tuning down high frequencies in the equalizer greatly helps.

So why am I writing this? For one thing, not everyone is into audio and I felt a written summary with my takeaways might be helpful. Second, 20 hours of audio / video make it really difficult to find specific parts you want to refer to. So I've added annotations of the lecture (#1..12) and timestamp (h:mm:ss) things are in, so at least for the parts that did matter to me, this summary provides an easy reference.

## What to Expect

Meehl calls the course's topic "empirical epistemology" (#1 10m). This has "a kind of prophylactic value that will I hope protect you from falling into silly philosophy of science reasoning and it will fend off your roommate if your roommate is trying to beat up on your preferred theory by philosophical arguments" (#1 20:27). They didn't have the internet and social media in 1989, but we might as well find some virtue in applying the lessons learned here in Reddit discussions, who knows. A large bonus are the anecdotes and stories Meehl shares, something you probably won't get out of Meehls papers, but he talks about extensively in the lectures:

> We got enough money from Carnegie and the hill and Rockefeller to bring the most distinguished logicians and philosophers and historians of science in the world - not just the United States - to come here to give lectures and sometimes to take a quarter leave or sometimes like Feyerabend for a whole academic year and I felt very privileged as a non-philosopher to be able to talk with these guys whose stuff I had read and argue with them and when I was a student I always enjoyed hearing some anecdotes about famous people. (...) I always thought it was interesting to hear about these great characters when I was a graduate student. The other side of it is that even in science itself (...,) especially in a sort of hazy area like meta theory or philosophy of science it often fills out your cognitive apprehension a bit to know what somebody said when pressed rather than what he said in his book and I could give you lots of examples of that. (#1 36:40)

## Main Cast of Characters

> I'm gonna be talking about certain people and certain movements over and over again and since I'm a little potty at my age, I tend to forget which watch things I talked about before. So I'd rather have all these people out to start with and then we can refer back to them. (#1 35:30)
