<p><em>Work in progress. People wanted to read a draft state, so here you go.</em></p>
<p>I spent two months looking into the general strategy of country-wide decarbonization. My example here is Germany but I do all calculations on a per-person level, so converting this to any other country should be only a small effort. My core target here is to build a baseline mental model of the current state and future development of energy supply and CO2 reduction on a country-wide level. Be warned that &ldquo;baseline model&rdquo; is way less than a detailed expert model: the model serves as a robust rough guide to the state of the world, but there are a lot of small details missing.</p>
<h1 id="part-1-base-problems-to-keep-in-mind">Part 1: Base Problems To Keep in Mind</h1>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have enough problems yet? Here you go.</p>
<p>I recommend skimming these sections first and only reading the details if you have enough time. If this feels like a drag to read, consider to jump ahead to part 2 and come back for these later. Really, I&rsquo;m sorry for so much text before we get to the actual model, but I need to introduce them before that.</p>
<h2 id="a-a-problem-of-scales">A) A problem of scales</h2>
<p>We often fail to appreciate the scales we&rsquo;re dealing with. But things are only practically feasible if they are available on the right scale. Base numbers (rounded very generously, from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy/country/germany">Germany: Energy Country Profile - Our World in Data</a> and <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-energy-consumption-and-power-mix-charts">Germany’s energy consumption and power mix in charts | Clean Energy Wire</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>An average person consumes ~1.500 kWh of electricity per year (compare this to the number on your electricity bill to see how you&rsquo;re doing)</li>
<li>Germany as a whole consumes ~500 TWh of electricity per year, or ~6.000 kWh per person and year (~84M inhabitants). Only 25% is private consumption, another ~30% &ldquo;trade and services&rdquo; and ~40% industry.</li>
<li>Total energy consumed is ~3500 TWh or 40.000 kWh per year and person. So only 8% of this is electricity. 33% of all energy consumed is from oil, another 25% is gas and 17% is coal - that&rsquo;s 75% fossile sources and only 25% &ldquo;green&rdquo; (includes 4%. nuclear as of 2021, so depending on whom you ask that doesn&rsquo;t count as green. Also 8%. wind, 3%. solar)</li>
<li>Energy consumption is 2:2:2:1 households:transport:industry:trades&amp;services. I haven&rsquo;t yet found good data on how this is spread over seasons - electricity production is <a href="https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/energiemonitor-deutschland-gaspreis-spritpreis-energieversorgung">30% higher in winter than summer</a>. I&rsquo;d expect this to be stronger for overall consumption (as it includes more heating) and glancing at the split of sources, it might very well be 2x higher overall energy consumption in winter than in summer (read as: one third of total energy use is in the warmer 6 months and two thirds are in the colder 6 months). There&rsquo;s a more detailed breakdown of energy flows by <a href="https://ag-energiebilanzen.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Energieflussbild-2020_PJ_lang_EN_20220405.pdf">AG Energiebilanzen e.V. here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some context and plausiblity checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon emission is ~0.2 kg/kWh, so 40.000 kWh per year and person equal 8T of CO2 per year and person. If we want to reduce that, we&rsquo;d have to either reduce the amount of energy consumed or the CO2-ness of it&rsquo;s source. Also there&rsquo;s additional carbon emitted by chemical processes (e.g., concrete) and CO2-equivalent stuff (e.g., methane from cows). So total CO2-equivalent is more like 11 T of CO2-equivalent per person and year, I guess.</li>
<li>By changing energy source, amount of energy consumed may change, too. Combustion-driven cars have 20..30% efficiency and use 5..9 l/100 km of gasoline = 60..100 kWh per 100 km; electric vehicles consume 15..20 kWh per 100 km. A heat pump should have a coefficient of performance of 3..4, so replacing a gasoline heater with a heat pump ideally reduces &ldquo;energy consumed&rdquo; by a factor 3..4. So assuming a factor 2 of improvement for switching all of today&rsquo;s energy need to electrified sources would imply a reduction of total energy demand from 40 MWh per person mentioned above to 20 MWh (again, really rough estimate).</li>
<li>The seasonality effects mentioned above still imply we have to store something like 5 MWh per person from summer to winter. This is way above the storage potential of batteries of all kinds: You&rsquo;d need the equivalent of 100 electric vehicles per person to provide enough storage for seasonal compensation (at 50 kWh per vehicle).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b-a-problem-of-limits-to-growth">B) A problem of limits to growth</h2>
<p>Limits change over time: Growth may be exponential, but occurs at limited rates nonetheless. Actually, nothing is exponential - there are limits to how far you can push something. Again, let&rsquo;s collect baseline numbers on what to expect. If not mentioned elsewere, data is from <a href="https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/energiemonitor-deutschland-gaspreis-spritpreis-energieversorgung">Energiemonitor (ZEIT ONLINE)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>solar power: 5 GW added per year, growing (target is increase to 22 GW/year in 2026; 1 W of capacity yields something like <a href="https://www.oeko-energie.de/shop1/de/Solarstrom/Solarmodule/Solarmodul-Wissen/Leistung--bzw--Ertrag-eines-Solarmodules/">1kWh of electricity per year</a>; so with 84M people we get 5GW = ~60 kWh per person and year; 22 GW = ~260 kWh per person and year). Prices follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson%27s_law#/media/File:Solar-pv-prices-vs-cumulative-capacity.png">Swanson&rsquo;s law - Wikipedia</a> and reduce by half every 5 years or so. Limits to growth: I haven&rsquo;t checked but it looks as if there&rsquo;s enough space to mount these on and enough Silicium to build them from.</li>
<li>wind power: ~2 GW added per year (target is increase to 7.8 GW/year in 2025; <a href="https://strom-report.de/windenergie/">64 GW installed power yield ~130 TWh per year</a>, so 1 W translates to ~2kWh of electricity per year). Here I&rsquo;m confused on the amount of space left but apparently a <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/klimaschutz/wind-an-land-gesetz-2052764">3x increase from 0.5..0.8% to 2% of land available for wind power</a> is at least theoretically possible.</li>
<li>bio-provided power: I&rsquo;ve only had a quick glance at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass">Biomass - Wikipedia</a>, but it looks like a factor 2..3 increase may be the best case and then we&rsquo;ve maxxed out the amount of plants we can grow.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity">pumped storage</a>: currently at <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpspeicherkraftwerk#Deutschland_2">40GWh capacity in Germany</a> (~0.5 kWh per person). Potential is limited to 7GWh in Germany, 8GWh in Austria, but &gt;100 GWh for France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Greece and ~1300 GWh for Norway (<a href="https://www.bves.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eStorage_Studie-1.pdf">pg. 40 here</a>). More details <a href="http://www.weltenergierat.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PDF-5_prognos_bericht_internationale_speicherung_wec_9_okt_2012.pdf">in this report (german)</a> - especially there&rsquo;s a large difference between amount of water stored in dams (filled by rivers and available on demand, e.g. 3TWh in Austria) and amount of water available to pump up hills (can behave like batteries to store excess power from the grid, that&rsquo;s what the numbers above refer to).</li>
<li>battery storage: currently at <a href="https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/leitthemen/stationaere-batteriespeicher/grossspeicher.html">0.75 GWh in Germany but this report argues that something like 60 GWh is possible until 2030</a>. The report estimates costs at currently ~500€/kWh and a ~2x drop in costs until 2030 (simplified by me, more details in source)</li>
<li>other medium-term storage: see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage">here</a> for an overview and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_energy_storage_power_plants">here</a> for a list of large-scale storages. Thermal storage is a thing for a few hours..days and molten salt for a few hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="c-a-problem-of-externalities">C) A problem of externalities</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a simple rule of thumb that we can usually expect secondary effects to be small, like maybe 10% of the main direct effect of something we observe. That&rsquo;s not zero, but in first approximation we may ignore the secondary effect of something and still get the order of magnitude of something right.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;usually&rdquo; is not always. Especially not with energy production - here the base rule of thumb is that secondary effects may be stronger than primary ones. Let&rsquo;s go through a few common options and think about unintended consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coal: baseline price ~<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_nuclear_power_plants#/media/File:3-Learning-curves-for-electricity-prices.png">10 ct/kWh electricity</a>; emits lots of CO2 (~<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/impacts-of-energy-sources">1 T CO2 per MWh</a>, equals 10ct/kWh at a CO2 price of 100€/T). Deaths from cancer caused by should add ~25 ct/kWh (based on 10M€ per life and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy">25 deaths per TWh</a>).</li>
<li>Oil is almost identical to coal except for baseline costs and handling (easier to work with on a small scale, like cars and house heating; not so great for steel production)</li>
<li>Gas: mostly like coal but with modified numbers: baseline price ~20..40 ct/kWh of electricity (depending on current gas prize, got a lot more expensive in 2022 due to a certain war), ~<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/impacts-of-energy-sources">0.4 T CO2 per MWh</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy">factor 10 lower deaths per energy</a> than coal.</li>
<li>Nuclear: production cost after building the plant ~3 ct/kWh. Production costs are usually projected to add ~5 ct/kWh, but these are megaprojects with cost escalation, so expect something like 10 ct/kWh. I don&rsquo;t know how to factor in risk of nuclear incidents, costs of waste storage and risk of nuclear war by having plutonium available everywhere. Estimates are all over the place, e.g., I&rsquo;ve seen ~30ct/kWh for long-term waste storage and &gt;100ct/kWh if you&rsquo;d try to actually insure against all nuclear risks (both numbers from people who probably don&rsquo;t like nuclear)</li>
<li>Wind: These days baseline price of 5 ct/kWh for new plants. Power output fluctuates wildly, expect factor X variation between &ldquo;not very much wind&rdquo; and &ldquo;lots of wind&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power#/media/File:Seasonal_cycle_of_capacity_factors_for_wind_and_photovoltaics_in_Europe_under_idealized_assumptions.png">but with stronger winds in autumn and winter</a>). Given the fluctuations, you need a significant battery capacity to buffer fluctuations that should increase costs significantly (maybe another 5 Ct/kWh). Wind turbines produce noise, interfere with birds, planes and everything else (e.g., whales if you build them offshore). Ideally, you can place them somewhere noone minds but in a densely populated country, there&rsquo;s a shortage of that.</li>
<li>Solar: These days baseline price of ~10 ct/kWh for new installations on rooftops, ~5 ct/kWh for standalone / large scale installations, I&rsquo;ve heard ~2 ct/kWh for large installations in spain). Power output fluctuates wildly: zero at night, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power#/media/File:Seasonal_cycle_of_capacity_factors_for_wind_and_photovoltaics_in_Europe_under_idealized_assumptions.png">factor 3</a> between spring/summer and autumn/winter due to daylight lenght and cloud intensity. Given the fluctuations, you need a significant battery capacity to buffer fluctuations that should increase costs significantly (maybe another 5 Ct/kWh).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="d-a-problem-of-perspectives">D) A problem of perspectives</h2>
<p>Curves often look smooth when sufficiently zoomed out, but change may feel very disruptive if you&rsquo;re directly affected. Effects will not apply to everyone the same way - an increase in gas costs doesn&rsquo;t matter at all if you&rsquo;re in a well-insulated house with a heat pump but very much if you&rsquo;re a small-income family in an old house. Timescales will differ on your perspective - sales of new cars may switch to electric vehicles now, but people will still drive old cars with combustion engines in 15 years from now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t always know how to factor in all of these. At least, I try my best not to forget them.</p>
<h1 id="part-2-a-baseline-model-of-energy-transition">Part 2: A baseline model of energy transition</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to put all of this together.</p>
<h2 id="fiddely-fluctuations">Fiddely Fluctuations</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.smard.de/en">https://www.smard.de/en</a> has data on hourly energy production. When writing this together I first made lots of screenshots, but then kicked them out for brevity (I encourage you to look at the dataset on your own). Things that really stood out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Renewables now make up a significant part of Germany&rsquo;s electricity production, close to 50%. But they fluctuate wildly! Much of this gets compensated by in- and decreasing coal-powered electricity, but we&rsquo;ve definitely hit a limit of this and in high-supply cases (= more renewables get produced than there&rsquo;s energy demand). Honestly I&rsquo;m surprised our grid can tolerate that much fluctuation, with wind power being mostly in the north.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="fluctuation_all.png" alt="">
<img src="fluctuation_legend.png" alt="">
(a few days from October 2022 in the <a href="https://www.smard.de/en/marktdaten?marketDataAttributes=%7B%22resolution%22:%22hour%22,%22from%22:1665808917927,%22to%22:1666759317926,%22moduleIds%22:%5B1004066,1001226,1001225,1004067,1004068,1001228,1001224,1001223,1004069,1004071,1004070,1001227,5000410%5D,%22selectedCategory%22:null,%22activeChart%22:true,%22style%22:%22color%22,%22categoriesModuleOrder%22:%7B%7D,%22region%22:%22DE%22%7D">SMARD data viewer</a>. The red curve is total demand, so I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s up with the difference - maybe import/export of electricity?)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Basically, we&rsquo;ve reached a level of renewables where higher shares are only possible by either accepting unused excess power in high-supply situations or adding significantly more storage to the grid. Maybe both. This matches other sources I&rsquo;ve seen claiming that at wind/solar above 30..40% of total electricity generated, you need buffering.</li>
<li>Following a rough &ldquo;factor 2 of fluctuation per day&rdquo;-model, we&rsquo;d need capacity to buffer something like 1 day of electricity in storage (to compensate for 2 bad days in a row). That would be something like 6 MWh per year / 365 days = 16 kWh per person. Thats… wow, that&rsquo;s just huge. I don&rsquo;t see a way adding that much storage to the grid at battery prices of 500€ per kWh, that&rsquo;s like an order of magnitude too high (rough estimate: if you pay 50€ per kWh and year and use that 100 times per year, that&rsquo;s still 50 Ct/kWh of stored energy). I&rsquo;m not saying we won&rsquo;t need storage, just that storage in the size of &ldquo;buffer energy for 2 days of low wind+sunshine&rdquo; is very unlikely to be available in the next ~10 years.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="renewables-rampup">Renewables rampup</h2>
<p>OK, so forget the storage, what if we just ramp up renewables? At some point there should be enough to cover everything, right?</p>
<p>Rough estimate: Assuming sufficient buffering is available, we&rsquo;d need another ~5 MWh * 84M people = 420 TWh of renewable generation to hit close to 100% renewable electricity generation. Maybe more like 10MWh per person if we shift all kinds of stuff to electricity. We plan to add something like 15 TWh of wind and 20 TWh of solar per year from 2025 on, so we&rsquo;ll reach the &ldquo;close to 100%&quot;-point some time after 2030, probably more like 2040.</p>
<p>Can we do better than this? I built a simple spreadsheet-based model of energy supply and demand by taking a base number and splitting it over the year by defining a summer and winter share and a fluctuation share to distinguish between good and bad days. (Again, all numbers on a per-capita base)</p>
<p><img src="simple_model_solar_supply.png" alt="simple_model_solar_supply.png"></p>
<p>I can do the same with wind (same capacity, but better yield at 2 kwh/W/year + summer/winter shares reversed) and with &ldquo;others&rdquo; (mostly biomass, so no fluctuation) ab a constant 50 W. All numbers are made up and only loosely grounded in reality. For 2020 and against 6 MWh/year base consumption, the model predicts an average share of 37% renewable electricity but fluctuation between 62% on good summer days and 18% on bad winter days, so at least we&rsquo;re not totally off.</p>
<p>So long story short, rough numbers for 2020 would be something like</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>year</th>
<th>demand</th>
<th>capacity solar</th>

<tr>
<td>This is a very much condensed view, but I don&rsquo;t trust the model too much anyways. In any case, we can now make wild guesses about future developments. Looking at intended increases in solar and wind capacity, I&rsquo;d expect something like 250 W solar and 150 W wind to be added for each year after 2026. Assuming a constant demand of 6 MWh, good days would be 100% renewable in 2030 and average days would be 100% renewable in 2040:</td>

<p>Of course demand will not remain at 6 MWh as we&rsquo;re shifting more stuff towards electricity. Let&rsquo;s make a wild guess here and assume demand will double until 2040, then we&rsquo;d have to cope with 12 MWh per person and year.</p>

<p>Of course, none of this is serious, but I&rsquo;m still impressed by how much power we could add. Up to a total of ~70% renewables, the model expects this to work without that much excess energy (renewable energy that ends up unused), 80% renewables are still reasonably reachable but everything above that really pushes you to a lot of energy wasted to get the last few percents together.</p>
